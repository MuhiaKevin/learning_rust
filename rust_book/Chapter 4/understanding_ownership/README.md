# Understanding Ownership

Rust uses two data structures: Heap and Stack to store data

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2308751/what-is-a-memory-heap

* Stack data structure:
    - It stores data in the order it gets them and removes them in opposite order
    - All data stored in the stack must have a fixed size 

* Heap Data structure:
    - Data that has unknown size at compile time or the size might change must be stored on the heap instead


* To store data with unkonw size, you request a certain amount of size
* The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough and marks it as being used and returns a pointer which is the address of that location (allocating on the heap).
* Becuse the pointer has a known fixed size, the pointer can now be store on the stack since accessing elements in the stack is faster
* When you want to access the data, you first get the pointer from the stack. The pointer will be followed to get the actual data.


## Analogy 

Think of being seated at a restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group ( you request a certain amount of size ), and the staff (memory allocator) finds an empty (find empty spot in the heap) table (heap) that fits everyone and leads you there (give a pointer to the memory location). If someone in your group comes late, they can ask where youâ€™ve been seated to find you (Getting pointer from the stack and following the pointer to the memory location).

* Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointe to get there

* Processors are faster if they jump less in memory 
* A processor can do its job better if it works on data thats close to other data rather than farther away 

## Ownership rules

* Each value in rust has an Owner
* There can only be one owner at a time
* When the owner goes out of scope the value will be dropped


## String slices

String slices are usually references to a part of a String

Example

```
 let s = String::from("hello world"); // this is the string
 let hello = &s[0..5];
 let world = &s[6..11];

```
